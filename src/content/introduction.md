I'm Ruiyang Sun ([/ru̯eɪ̯ jɑŋ swən/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%2Fru̯e%C9%AA̯%20j%C9%91ŋ%20sw%C9%99n%2F&voice=Joey), or Ryan Sun; 孙睿阳). I'm a 🎓 senior undergraduate student pursuing a double major in 🧲 *Physics* and 🤖 *Artificial Intelligence* (AI) at **🏛️ Peking University**.

I have previously worked in the areas of **🔒 Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)** and **🤖🧭 LLM Alignment**, under the guidance of [Prof. Yaodong Yang](https://www.yangyaodong.com) at the [PKU Pair Lab](https://pair-lab.com).

Currently, my research is focused on **🌱 Emergent Socio-Dynamic Behavior** and **🧩 Alignment Issues** in **🤖👥 AI-Human Societies**, particularly focusing on advanced AI systems such as 🗣️ Large Language Models (LLMs), 🖼️ Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), and 🤖💼 LLM-powered Autonomous Agents. I aim for my research to contribute to the safer, more harmonious, and dignified integration of 🤖 AI systems into 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 human society. Here are some of the key research questions I'm exploring:

1. When 🤖 AI systems are treated as human-like entities in AI-human mixed ecosystems, can we observe the **🌟 emergence of human-like socio-dynamic behaviors** from these AI systems?

2. In what ways do the behaviors of 🤖 AI systems diverge from those of 👥 humans, and how can these distinctions inform our understanding of **human-AI 🤝 interactions**?

3. How can emergent behaviors (e.g., **🤝 social learning**, **🤗 cooperation**) enhance the intelligence of 🤖 AI systems and the **collective 🧠 intelligence** of AI-human societies?

4. What forms of **⚠️ misalignment** might arise between 👥 human and 🤖 AI systems in AI-human mixed ecosystems, and what strategies can be used to **🛠️ mitigate these misalignments** effectively?

I believe that to develop more 🤖 intelligent and ethical AI systems, we need to draw insights not only from **💻 Computer Science** but also from fields like **🧠 Psychology**, **👥 Sociology**, and **🧠 Cognitive Science**. I welcome discussions from people with diverse perspectives! 🌍

Besides research, I'm also a passionate 🍎 Apple developer, and I am currently working on creating a new 🤖 AI-powered teamwork research toolkit. I'd love to discuss or collaborate on this with anyone interested! 🤝
