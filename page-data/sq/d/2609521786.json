{"data":{"introduction":{"html":"<p>I'm Ruiyang Sun (<a href=\"http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%2Fru%CC%AFe%C9%AA%CC%AF%20j%C9%91%C5%8B%20sw%C9%99n%2F&#x26;voice=Joey\">/ru̯eɪ̯ jɑŋ swən/</a>, or Ryan Sun; 孙睿阳). I'm a 🎓 senior undergraduate student pursuing a double major in 🧲 <em>Physics</em> and 🤖 <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> (AI) at <strong>🏛️ Peking University</strong>.</p>\n<p>I have previously worked in the areas of <strong>🔒 Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL)</strong> and <strong>🤖🧭 LLM Alignment</strong>, under the guidance of <a href=\"https://www.yangyaodong.com\">Prof. Yaodong Yang</a> at the <a href=\"https://pair-lab.com\">PKU Pair Lab</a>. Currently, my research is focused on <strong>🌱 Emergent Socio-Dynamic Behavior</strong> and <strong>🧩 Alignment Issues</strong> in <strong>🤖👥 AI-Human Societies</strong>, particularly focusing on advanced AI systems such as 🗣️ Large Language Models (LLMs), 🖼️ Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), and 🤖💼 LLM-powered Autonomous Agents. I aim for my research to contribute to the safer, more harmonious, and dignified integration of 🤖 AI systems into 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 human society. Here are some of the key research questions I'm exploring:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When 🤖 AI systems are treated as human-like entities in AI-human mixed ecosystems, can we observe the <strong>🌟 emergence of human-like socio-dynamic behaviors</strong> from these AI systems?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In what ways do the behaviors of 🤖 AI systems diverge from those of 👥 humans, and how can these distinctions inform our understanding of <strong>human-AI 🤝 interactions</strong>?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How can emergent behaviors (e.g., <strong>🤝 social learning</strong>, <strong>🤗 cooperation</strong>) enhance the intelligence of 🤖 AI systems and the <strong>collective 🧠 intelligence</strong> of AI-human societies?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What forms of <strong>⚠️ misalignment</strong> might arise between 👥 human and 🤖 AI systems in AI-human mixed ecosystems, and what strategies can be used to <strong>🛠️ mitigate these misalignments</strong> effectively?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe that to develop more 🤖 intelligent and ethical AI systems, we need to draw insights not only from <strong>💻 Computer Science</strong> but also from fields like <strong>🧠 Psychology</strong>, <strong>👥 Sociology</strong>, and <strong>🧠 Cognitive Science</strong>. I welcome discussions from people with diverse perspectives! 🌍</p>\n<p>Besides research, I'm also a passionate 🍎 Apple developer, and I am currently working on creating a new 🤖 AI-powered teamwork research toolkit. I'd love to discuss or collaborate on this with anyone interested! 🤝</p>"}}}
